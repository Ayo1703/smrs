My Student Result Managemeyn System Life Cycle
This project demonstrates the full Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) and a working implementation using python only.
1. Project Overview

Project Name: Student Result Management System (SRMS)

Purpose:
SRMS is a console-based Python application that allows an administrator to:

- Register students
- Record student results
- View student results

This system replaces manual result recording with a simple automated solution.
2. SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT LIFE CYCLE (SDLC)

The SDLC explains how the system was planned and developed. It is conceptual and separate from code.

Planning & Requirements
Problem:
Manual result management is slow, error-prone, and difficult to maintain.

Solution:
Develop a Python-based system to manage student results efficiently.

- Functional Requirements:
- Add student
- Add result
- View student result

System Design

System Type: Console Application
Programming Language: Python
Data Storage: SQLite Database

Database Tables:
- students (matric_no, name, department)
- results (matric_no, course_code, score, grade)

Implementation
- Implement the system using Python
- Use functions to represent system operations
- Use SQLite for data persistence

 Testing
- Add student with valid data → successful save
- Add result with score → correct grade generated
- View result with matric number → correct output

Deployment & Maintenance
- Run the program using the Python interpreter
- Update features and fix bugs when required

  Conclusion
  The Student Result Management System (SRMS) demonstrates a simple, clear SDLC and a fully functional Python-only implementation, making it suitable for academic submission and first-year Software Engineering assessment.
